# PIC-Serial-RS232-Communication
This is an example of Serial (RS232) communication with a PIC microcontroller. The PIC processor sends the integer value of "5" over Serial (RS232) communication. Serial (RS232) communication occurs through the pins of the PIC microcontroller.

PIC Model: PIC18F4550

IDE Version: PIC C Compiler (CCS C Compiler) v5.008

Datasheets: The PIC18F4450 pinout diagram is shown in the image (PIC18f4550.png). You can test Serial (RS232) communication between the PIC processor and a PC. The connection between the PIC and the PC is shown in the image (PIC-USB Connection.png).
